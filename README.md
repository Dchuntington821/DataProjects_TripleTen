# TripleTen_Projects
This repository contains most of the projects I completed during my studies in TripleTen's Data Science Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Instacart Analysis | Analyze data instacart data to find trends and patterns to determine how customers are using instacart. |
| 2 | Megaline EDA Hypothesis Test | Perform an EDA on data from the cellular provider, Megaline to determine how subscribers are using their plans. This EDA included analysis on revenue per plan type and a Hypothesis Test which checked for a statistical significance in average revenue between two regions.  |
| 3 | Games Analysis | Analyze trends in popular game types and gaming platforms to determine the most effective marketing strategy for the next year. |
| 4 | Taxi EDA Hypothesis Test| Find the top ten dropoff locations between taxi companies and visualize the amount of trips differing companies take. Run a hypothesis test to check for a stastically significant difference between routes on rainy and clear days.|
| 5 | Megaline Machine Learning | Build a Classification Model that can predict the cellular plan a customer has. Final Model must have an accuracy score of at least 0.75 |
| 6 | Beta Bank Machine Learning | Build a Regression Model that predicts if a client will close their account soon. Final Model must have the highest F1 score. |
| 7 | Oily Giant Machine Learning | Perform an EDA for three different regions where OilyGiant operates oil wells. Build a model that can accurately predict the reserve volume in new wells. Determine the most profitable region while taking the companies' budget and amount of new wells to be built into account.|
| 8 | Zyfra Machine Learning | Perform an EDA and create a prototype predictive model that accurately predicts the amount of gold recovered at different stages of extraction. |
| 9 | Rusty Bargain Machine Learning | Using standard and gradient boosted methods, build a predictive model that produces accurate predictions for the price of vehicles while minimizaing both training and prediction time. |
| 10 | Sweet Lift Taxi Machine Learning | Build a time series regression model that accurately predicts the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Engineer features so that the RMSE is no less than 48. |
| 11 | Film Sentiment Analysis | Perform an EDA on the data.  Process IMDB movie reviews through normalizing, tokenizing, lemmatizing and completing TF_IDF transformations. Build a predictive model that can classify reviews as either positive or negative. F1 score must be at least 0.85. |
