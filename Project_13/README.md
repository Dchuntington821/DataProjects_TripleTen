<b> Project Description: </b>

This was a collaborative coding competition I signed up for through TripleTen. I was assigned 3 team members to complete this project with. The goal of the project was three-fold:

1. Develop a webscraper to scrape both actor and movie information from the IMDB top 250 page.
2. Formulate three questions and perform and EDA on the scraped data to address these questions.
3. Create a presentation to present the construction of the web-scraper and the findings of the EDA to our peers and a panel of judges.



<b>Web Scrapers:</b> We developed two web-scrapers using Beautiful soup and Selenium. 
1. The first web-scraper extracted move titles, ratings, and a few of pieces of information including the links to each movies actor page.
2. The second scraper iterated through the links from the first scraper and pulled the information of the lead actors.
Result: This left us with a very clean, almost complete dataframe of 250 movies with ratings, and actor information.


<b>Data & EDA:</b> Performed data manipulation and visualization to address three questions.
1. Is there a relationship between movie duration and release year?
2. Is there a correlation between oscars nominated/oscars won and popularity score?
3. What is the distribution of rating class by genre?


<b> Presentation:</b>
1. Designed a themed PowerPoint covering scraper construction and the insights obtained from the EDA.
2. Presented findings to judges and peer teams.

<b>Collaboration:</b> We primarily used discord for communcation and team meetings while leveraging both Google Collab and Github for collaboration on both the web-scrapers and the EDA.

<b>Results:</b>

My team secured first place by earning 53/58 points.
